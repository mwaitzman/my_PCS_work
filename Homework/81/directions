Please do the following for homework.

Build a photo viewing app. Present the user with a search box and a button. When the user clicks the button, load pictures and display them to the user. You can pretend to honor the search by having 2 different files e.g. dogs,json and cats,json. If the user enters dogs you fetch the dogs file, if they enter cats you return the cats, otherwise you return nothing...

Show title and picture for each picture. If you want to get fancy, show one picture at a time with next and previous buttons (i.e. a carousel - but do this after you get the simple case, showing all the pictures at once, working)

Take some time to make something impressive that you would be proud to show to someone. Dont just throw the pictures on the page. Use your combined html/css/javascript skills to make the page nice and the user experience impressive.

(Note that as mentionedÂ there are free photo apis out there that could be used that would perhaps make this example more impressive but we will stick with a homegrown json file and pictures instead rather than have to use something likely blocked (for good reason) by most filters.)
