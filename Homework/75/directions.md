For homework, add another helper function to the pcs tools dom helper (jQuery lite)  we wrote in class: 

*	Add a function to cause the element to change colors (like the homework from a few classes ago where you flashed background colors on an interval). Allow the user to pass in the length of time to flash the element for, and maybe also an optional number to control the speed of the flashing

*	Extra exercise for those that have the time to do it:

	* Add another function(s) to pcs tools to allow the user to associate arbitrary data with an element. e.g myWrappedElement.data('foo", 5) will store the key value pair foo = 5 for this element, then later you can call myWrappedElement.data("foo") and get back 5. Calling myOtherWrappedElement.data('bar", 'something else') and then later myOtherWrappedElement.data("bar") would get back 'something else'.
