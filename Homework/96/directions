For homework, redo the orders quiz as a react app (but hard code the order to show as we haven't done user interactions yet so no way for the user to pick one).
No need to get fancy with the UI, just a basic display of order, customer, items, total as we did in that example.
This will actually be a nice example for you to compare and contrast to see if you find the React version an improvement over what you wrote without its help. I hope you are convinced it's an improvement.
(Note: I have not actually coded this example and usually I like to do all homeworks before assigning them to make sure there are no gotchas that we haven't covered, but I don't think there should be any. If you do run into a road block please ask).
