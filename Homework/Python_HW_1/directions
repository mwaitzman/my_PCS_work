For homework

1 - Create a "die" class (FYI a die is the singular of dice). The class should allow the developer to decide how many sides it should have when creating it.
Normal dice have 6 sides, but there are some games with weirdly shaped dice that have more sides, The die should have a method "roll" that when rolled picks a random number between 1 and
the number of sides so a 6 sided die returns a number between 1 and 6, a 12 sided
die a number between 1 and 12

2 - Since 6 sided dice are so common, make a subclass SixSidedDie that always
has 6 sides.

3 - create an instance of each and roll it 10 times, printing out what you get
