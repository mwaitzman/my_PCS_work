For homework update your recipe homework (or the version from class) to have the top level app component be a functional component instead of a class component. Since it currently has state (the recipes array, and the selected recipe index) we will need to use the useState hook to make this work.
Basically it should be exactly the same as the counter example we did in class.
(Bring in useState to have access to the use state hook, then set initial state, and update on change using either of the 2 approaches we saw for setting multiple pieces of state - either separate state for each - recipes and selectedRecipe (as we did first for count and count2) or as a single state object (more similar to how we did it as a class component, as we did afterwards, combining count and count2 into 1 object). If you take the latter approach, recall the when you set the state on changes, you need to do any merging yourself and cant just pass the changed values and it will be merged automatically with the unchanged ones. In a functional component you need to do this yourself and pass the full state object.)

Please continue to work on the previous hw as well - to create a simple blog site (first non React version then React version),
