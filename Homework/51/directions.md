For homework please do the following:

    Create the beginnings of a simple website for a fictional restaurant. Use your imagination to design and style it. You will be expanding on this site in future homeworks.

*    Have a home page where you give some general information about the restaurant. Also include some appropriate pictures. 
*    From the home page have links to an Our Menu page (and any other pages you feel like writing)
*    On the Our Menu page, have a few menu items where each item is described with text and has an image of the item as well.
*    For at least one or two of the menu items have a link to yet another page that goes into greater detail about the item.
*    On all pages have a link to take the user back to the home page. Make sure the title is set appropriately for each page (title element in head) as well. Make sure all pages are properly structured with correct html.

We will continue to learn new elements and see how to use css to style them over the next several classes but meanwhile use the few we have seen so far. You will be able to make it look nicer in future homeworks when we have more tools available.
