For homework, finish up the snake game. Use code from class as a starting point (or start from scratch if you prefer).
Things to add:

    Grow the snake when an apple is eaten. This might be somewhat challenging, don't give up.... One way to approach this is to change the single x and y used now into an array of points that represent the different snake segments. Each time an apple is eaten add a new segment to the array as a new tail portion (or I suppose head if you prefer). The code currently checking for eating apple, bumping into walls etc will check the first element in the array - thats the head. When moving, either update all segments starting from tail to have the old value of segment in front of them, and head gets new position OR more efficiently, as discussed in class, realizing that only tail and head positions actually visually change, pop of tail - removing it, and then unshift it with the new x and y as a new head (rest of body can stay as it was). When rendering, loop through the array and draw each (you can just use draw rect for body parts if you don't like a multi headed snake...).
    Once snake can grow, check for collisions with self. Game over... also make sure apple not placed under any part of snake.
