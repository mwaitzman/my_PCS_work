1. Add a table to one of your restaurant pages showing some interesting data about your restaurant. Use "zebra" striping (alternating background colors) to make the table easier to read. Use the nth child selector to do this. Make the last column (thats column, not row) in the table look in some way different from the other columns (you might use :last-child selector to do this). Table should have a thead, tbody, and tfoot.
2. Add a form to a page of your restaurant asking the users to submit feedback about your restaurant. Get at least customers name, email, date visited, a rating, and comments. Use appropriate input types (text, email, range, textarea). When submitted, have form POST the data to an imaginary page feedback.php (which could be a php page that would process the form and return something useful to the user, but for now will simply 404 as no such page actually exists yet). Use some HTML5 validation attributes like required, minlength, min, etc... to ensure the submitted data is valid.
