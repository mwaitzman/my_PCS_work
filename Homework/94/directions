For homework please do the following:

    We didn't see much of React, certainly not enough to use it correctly but we did get introduced to JSX. You can practice writing some JSX using the same starter file we used in class -https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/master/static/html/single-file-example.html. Again, this isn't the correct way to use react, and we will never use it this way again in class, but it's good enough to practice some JSX. Write code using JSX to render some content to the page. As we did in class, rather then just hard coding JSX in the call to render, instead save the JSX in a variable to get a feel for the fact that JSX actually results in an object - the element returned by the call to React.createElement which all JSX gets turned into by babel... Also use curly brackets {} to embed some normal javascript in your JSX as we did in class. At this point we haven't really seen how to use React or what's good about it. We will iy"h start seeing that next class.
    It seems that many people are still having trouble working with Webpack. While not necessary to become an expert at using it, you do want to be comfortable with the basic ideas. If you were unable to complete last night's homework (for reasons other then filter issues. If you have filter issues, you need to resolve them first with your filter company), try to create a basic project from scratch that uses webpack and use some of the more basic but important features that we saw in class. 

    Basically you should be able to do everything we did in class (import js, css, images, htmlWebpackPlugin, map files for debugging, eslint, use webpack dev server etc..). The webpack config (and package.json) that we had for snake could serve as a starter for you as it already has these things setup and configured. (there shouldn't be much for you to do if you use these 2 files as a starting point)
