Continue styling your restaurant with some of the new html elements and css we learnt. In particular do the following:
1 - Use the new types of selectors we saw:

    id selectors - e.g. #copyright
    class selectors - e.g. .menu-item  

You can of course use these in combination so #copyright .menuItem p {} would apply to all paragraphs in an element with class menuItem in the element with id of copyright...

2 - Use at least some of the new css properties we saw, somewhere in your site.

    text-shadow
    letter-spacing
    line-height
    text-transform (capitalize, uppercase etc)
    transform (translate, rotate, scale, skew)
    float and clear

We saw vertical-align, and display: inline as well. These may be useful to you depending on what you're doing.
I think that's all the ones we've seen so far (plus the ones listed in last homework that you should already be using and list specific ones like list-style, list-style-type and list-style-image - see below where a list is needed so the list specific ones might come in handy there)

3 - Make your pages not full width on a big screen - yet responsive so as to not cause scrolling on a small screen (e.g. max-width or width using %) as we did in class (reminder flexbox and css grid which we will see later can often be better choices for layout problems)

4 - Put (at least some of) your links (anchors) in a nav (navigation) element (if not already in one - we did that in class last time) and a list element (probably a UL) - after all, semantically it is a list of links... Style as needed (recall we made an inline list in class if that's a style you would find useful...)

5 - Style (at least some of ) your `<a>` elements (recall that besides basic styles on an a element you can also target the pseudo class selectors a:link, a:visited, a:hover, a:focus, and a:active)

6 - rename your home page - index.html if not named that already!
