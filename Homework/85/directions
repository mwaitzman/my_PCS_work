We spent a long time reviewing the last homework and as such didn't have a chance to actually cover any new material. Homework therefore is to continue working on your potato head game, adding any missing features that were supposed to be completed originally (e.g. saving to and loading from local storage) or adding new extra ones e.g. ability to choose backgrounds, music, multiple "profiles" where each can save multiple pictures, etc... We saw lots of good ideas looking at peoples work in class so lots of things to get your imagination working.
