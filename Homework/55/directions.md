For homework please do the following to your restaurant site:

    Use some different fonts.
        Use at least one web font.
    Add some audio and video
    Use position: fixed to position something in your page. One idea of something to do this to might be some or all of your links.
    Use a CSS reset or normalizer. (perhaps not so important anymore in 2021 as most browsers doing a pretty good job of displaying things in an expected way but good css practice for you anyway)
