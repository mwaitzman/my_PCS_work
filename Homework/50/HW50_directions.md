For homework, create the following web page (You can look at the file we did in class as a template to ensure you get the html correct - but type it all in - don't cut and paste. You want to do that a few times to get used to what it is - with correct syntax which cut and paste won't really teach you...)

Create a page called shoes.html that might be the home page for a (very plain looking) shoe store. Include the following:

-    The name of the store in the title element. This should appear as the text that shows up in the browser tab.
-    The name of the store as a h1 element at the beginning of the body.
-    The different departments as h2 elements (e.g. mens, womens, childrens).
-    Describe one or two shoes for sale using paragraphs in each department. We haven't seen images yet so just some simple text for now.

Obviously a real store would want a much nicer looking page - we will learn ways to do that over the next several classes.
