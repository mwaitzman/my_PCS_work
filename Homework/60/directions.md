For homework::
Do some examples using named areas
1 - Redo the example from last homework using named areas.

2 - In class we did several examples of using media queries to change the layout on different sized screens by changing the definition of the grid area. Do an example of this on your own. Define a layout using named areas, and then use media queries to change the layout by changing the defined grid areas. You can do this on a page in your restaurant site if you want to, or you can just do a standalone page if you prefer.
