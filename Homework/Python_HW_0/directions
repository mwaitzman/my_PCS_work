For homework:

        Install python :)
        Create a list containing a few fruit names and print it out.
        Print out from the third character through the third to last character (inclusive) in the name of the second to last fruit in the fruits list (make sure you use a fruit name that's big enough to get something....)
        Write a Python script to print out the times tables from 1 to 10. (1,2,3, etc... 2,4,6, etc... 3,6,9, etc...)
        Write a guess the number game. Computer picks a number and asks the user to guess it. User keeps trying until they get it right.

        You can hard code the picked number - or import the random module (like we imported the math module) and use random.randint to get a random number, e.g., 
        random.randint(1, 101) # pick a number between 1 and 100

        Make sure to gracefully handle bad input from the user (non numeric characters) and not crash.

        Extra credit to tell the user if they guessed too low or too high.
