For homework do the following:

- configure your linter to not allow var.
- declare some variables using let and const.
- do some comparisons using === and/or !== and prove you dont get free type coercion (5 == '5')...-
- make a variable be NaN and then write code that does something only if the value of the variable is NaN.

At this point we are still exploring language basics, we didn't really get to where we needed to, to allow for a more substantial homework yet. Hopefully next class.
