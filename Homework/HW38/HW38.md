Describe why structured data is a better candidate for a relational DB?
    With structured data, it is much easier, faster, and overall more efficient to parse and CRUD individual records

Describe where the different approaches (top-down, bottom-up, centralized, un-centralized) work best?
    TD is best for a big project where you want to have a well-defined idea of what everything is/will do, whereas BU is best for a small project where you just want to start working right away. Decentralized design is best for a large and complex system; otherwise, centralized design is better.

Describe why there is a need for process such as DBLC The Database Life Cycle?
    It specifies what's happening next so everyone involved in the database knows what's happening and is on the same page
