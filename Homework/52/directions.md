For homework please do the following:
Begin to style your restaurant pages as you see fit. (Don't simply copy styles I may have used in class, use your own imagination, you won't be graded on your artistic talent, but do try to make it look decent). Use a site wide style sheet to ensure that all your sites pages have the same basic look and feel. Some pages of course can have their own unique styles as well (either in a style element in head or as a separate stylesheet loaded just by that page).

We haven't seen that much css yet but we did see the following. Be sure to use all of these somewhere on your site:

*    color - there are many ways to choose a color, so far we have just used color names e.g. red. For a list of color names you can use google html color names e.g. [htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/). we will see other ways of using colors which allow you to pick pretty much any conceivable color you might want, not just a few from a list
*    background-color - same colors as color
*    font-size - e.g px, %, em, rem
*    font-style - e.g normal, italic
*    font-weight - e.g normal, bold, bolder
*    text-align - e.g left, center, right, justify
*    border
*    border-radius
*    padding
*    margin
    height and width (you might want to also use box-sizing: border-box...)
    we also saw overflow, when you use height and width you can make it appropriate to set overflow behavior as well.

So far we have used only 1 type of "selector", the type selector (e.g. p for all paragraphs). Recall also that multiple selectors can be combined for one rule by using a comma between - e.g. header, p {} will apply to both header and p elements and we can also make a selector more specific by combining selectors without the comma, e.g. header p {} will apply only to p that are in a header element. Use some of these rather than all just simple 1 part selectors.
You should also add some of the new semantic HTML element types we saw like header, article, nav.
